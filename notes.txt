LINQ

Home controller:

Imagine the DB model was SpaceCat, Fake DB:

SpaceCat[] allCats = new SpaceCat[];

IEnumerable<SpaceCat> orderedByLives = allCats.OrderBy(cats(variable name could be anything) => cats.Lives); LINQ Query
IEnumerable<SpaceCat> orderedByNames = allCats.OrderBy(cats(variable name could be anything) => cats.Name);  LINQ Query

ViewBag.SpaceCatsLives = orderedByLives;
ViewBag.SpaceCatsNames = orderedByNames;

<hr> gives you a page break on Views (not LINQ related)

IEnumerable<SpaceCat> DogEnemies = allCats.Where(c => c.MortalEnemy == "Dogs"); LINQ Query WHERE ALWAYS passes back a list even if it's only 1.

SpaceCat Cannon = allCats.FirstOrDefault(b => b.Weapon == "Plasma Cannon"); LINQ Query this is looking for one(or only the first?) and not putting it in a list.

ViewBag.EnemyDogs = DogEnemies;
